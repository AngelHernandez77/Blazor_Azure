# Info

This app was created for an assignment in a Programming 2 class. It is a blazor application that builds into a website. It uses HTML, CSS, and C# programming languages. I have completed two courses using C#, so I already knew a thing or two, but it was great to go back. I might come back to update this project in the near future but it is not a priority right now.
